# The film _Only Yesterday_, Fractions, and Math Education

## About: _Only Yesterday_

- A general appraisal of the film
    - Being followed by her 10 year old self
    - Acceptance of self
- Introducing the character and her family
    - Her relationship with her family (constantly put down, unappreciated, envious of her sisters, looked down "special")

## Mathematics and Self Esteem

- Introducing the arc:
    - Her qn to forgot-his-name
    - Self esteem and identity and adulthood
    - What happened?
        - Test results and intense shame
        - Mention the sister and mother
            - Sister's dismissal AND condescension
            - Mom exacerbates the shame
        - Mention her cutting apples to try to understand

- Personal feelings when watching this arc

- Appreciating the depth of the qn
    - Teaching clar negative numbers
    - Non trivial conceptions of zero, negatives, irrationals in history
    - How such questions lead to deep fundamental math revelations
    

## Math Education

- (briefly) How schools fail in teaching Math
    - Just do, don't need to understand
    - Instiling shame in being "slower"
    - {TODO: Research}

## Wrapping up

- {TODO}

## _Dividing Fractions_

### _Dividing Fractions_: Concrete Explanation

- idk just build up from intuition of division over integers with pictures and stuff

### _Dividing Fractions_: Abstract Explanation

- Start with Commutative Rings (Z) and build up to embedding in Field of Fraction (Q)
- idk how to structure this help

Okay, Concepts:
- Definition of commutative rings
