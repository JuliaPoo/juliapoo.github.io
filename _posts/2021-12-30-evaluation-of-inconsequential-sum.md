excerpt: "A lot of notation in service to evaluate an inconsequential sum regarding arithmetic functions. This post serves more as a record of work done in [INSERT YEAR]."

## Metadata

Ever pursued something just because it satisfied the bare minimum of visual aesthetics?

$$
\sum_{s = 1}^{2022} \sum_{a,l,g,o,r,i,t,h,m = 1}^\infty \cfrac{\cos\left[\cfrac{2i\pi}{2022} algorithms\right]}{(algorithm)^2} = ?
$$

## The Actual Sum

$$
S = \sum _{b=1}^k \sum_{a_1,a_2\cdots a_n = 0}^\infty \frac{\cos\left[\cfrac{2i\pi}{k} ba_1a_2\cdots a_n\right]}{(a_1a_2\cdots a_n)^s}
$$
