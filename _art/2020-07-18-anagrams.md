## Metadata

Anagrams! This visualisation idea is by caryhk and he created a generalisation of palindromes where you can group letters to make a non-palindrome into a palindrome. I just used it for anagrams instead. Unfortunately this technique can't apply to all anagrams but its a fun puzzle to figure out which anagrams can and can't be visualised this way.

You can explore more of this [here](https://htwins.net/palindrome/).
