        Parts of the inverse matrix that transforms 24 bit output of MT19937 into its internal state, super-imposed with different colours. 24 bits is chosen because it gives the most interesting patterns.

        Parts of the matrix that transforms MT19937 internal state to its 32-bit output, super-imposed with different colours. The black-ness demonstrates how bad MT19937 is at diffusion, and the fact that it can be represented as a matrix shows that its also completely linear.

## Metadata

There's order in random number generators because computers. MT19937 in particular has maybe _to much_ order (it isn't cryptographically-secure).
