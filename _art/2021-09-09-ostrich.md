Ive been following an amazing course on origami design by The Plant Psychologist (playlist on youtube) and this was the homework for the first lesson

Am pretty happy with how it turned out **^-^**. Had a lot of trouble shaping the neck and body, and it took me 4 versions to get the legs and body proportions right.
