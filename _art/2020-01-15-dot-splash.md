## Metadata

_**2022 note**_: This was old work. Luckily I have the original gifs somewhere on my computer.

I distinctively remember a lot of, a lot, of messy, messy code to create these.

A significant amount of image processing and [Optical Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow), all in Python.

## Code

It's lost. Probably forever. Probably for the best.
