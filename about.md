# $$\displaystyle \forall a \in A: 1 \times a = a$$

Hi! I'm J̷̨̡͚̝͔̜̋̎̄̉͌͛͘ũ̷̺̯̊͘l̶̛̥̻̠͔̠̃͗͒̕̚͜͠͠è̷̱ṡ̶̨͓̜͖̗̤̞͠, still a student and unsure what to work on.

I've gained interest in many areas, which will probably be reflected in the messiness of this site in time to come. I've particular interest in Mathematics, Cryptography and Low level programming. Occasionally I do generative art and origami, and sometimes pursue cursed ideas.

If you find anything interesting and wanna tell me, or just wanna talk to me, I'm reachable at:
