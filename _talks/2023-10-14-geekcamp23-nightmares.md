excerpt: |
    How [Artfuscator](https://github.com/JuliaPoo/artfuscator), a project written in 24 hours while having a high fever with covid, works, and the motivations behind it.

    Disclaimer: This project looks like a monumental achievement in compiler technology and it is but most of the work wasnt by me: I built Artfuscator on ELVM.
